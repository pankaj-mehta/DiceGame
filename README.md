This is the 1st Boss Level Challenge Project for The Complete Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu.
The website simulates a dice game challenge where on every refresh both dice are thrown simultaneously and a random dice number is generated for both players. The player with larger Dice number wins!
